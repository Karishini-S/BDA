The one thing wish we could take with us? That salty sea breeze. This all-natural spray manages, magically, to bottle the effect of sea mist so you can have it all the time. A quick spray in your hair imparts that impossibly perfect texture that comes from a swim in the ocean and a sprawl in the sun."],

"title": "Such a lovely scent but not overpowering.",

"text": "This spray is really nice. It smells really good, goes on really fine, and does the trick. I will say it feels like you need a lot of it though to get the texture I want. I have a lot of hair, medium thickness. I am comparing to other brands with yucky chemicals so I'm gonna stick with this. Try it!",
